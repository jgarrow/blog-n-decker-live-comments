<Intro>

An overview of the basics of Theme UI, a "design graph framework". Find the official docs [here](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started).

This post assumes a basic knowledge of CSS and React. Familiarity with Styled Components is helpful.

# Intro to Theme UI

<Content>

At its core, Theme UI lets you create a "theme", an object that contains all of the styles that you want to be consistent across your application. You can then use those theme styles throughout your UI. Let's take a closer look.

<Zoom value={0.35}/>

```jsx
export default {
  colors: {
    text: "#000",
    background: "#fff",
    primary: "tomato",
  },
  fonts: {
    body: "system-ui, sans-serif",
    heading: '"Avenir Next", sans-serif',
  },
}
```

## Create your theme

After installing Theme UI by running `npm i theme-ui`, create your theme file with the styles you want to be part of your application's theme. This will be an object that follows some standard "Theme Specification" rules.

To speed up the process and get up and running, you can use some [pre-made themes](https://theme-ui.com/packages/presets/) or use the [Theme UI GUI](https://theme-ui.com/customize) to create your own basic theme and copy and paste the code snippet from that.

There are a LOT of theming options, so we won't go into detail about what they all are here. You can check it out in the [docs](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec).

<Zoom value={0.35}/>

```jsx
// App.js
import React from "react"
import { ThemeProvider } from "theme-ui"
import theme from "./theme" // your theme

export default ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>
)
```

<Content>

## `ThemeProvider`

Now that we've created our theme, we need to give all of our components access to it. We can do this by wrapping our `App` in a `ThemeProvider`. If you're familiar with React's Context API, this will look familiar. We can import our theme and pass it in as the value for the `ThemeProvider` `theme` prop. Now every component nested inside of our `ThemeProvider` can access our theme styles!

</Content>

<Zoom value={0.35}/>

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

export default (props) => (
  <div
    {...props}
    sx={{
      // values referencing scales defined in a theme
      color: "primary",
      bg: "background",
      fontFamily: "body",
      // raw CSS value
      boxShadow: "0 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .125)",
    }}
  />
)
```

<Content>

## The `sx` prop

In order to access the styles from your theme inside of your components, you have to import `jsx` from Theme UI. Note: you MUST include the `/** @jsx jsx */` comment at the very top above the actual import, otherwise it will break.

When import `jsx`, you don't need to import `React` from 'react' since both are using jsx. You can save yourself an extra import :)

Within your jsx tags, you can use Theme UI's `sx` prop in place of `style` or `css`. This allows you to access the styles from your theme while still being able to use the normal functionality of `style`/`css`! In our example here, we're accessing the `primary` and `background` color values found in our theme file, but then using raw CSS for the value for the box shadow.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"
import { Button } from "theme-ui"

export default (props) => (
  <div>
    <Button mr={2}>Beep</Button>
    <Button variant="secondary">Boop</Button>
  </div>
)
```

## Theme UI Components

Theme UI comes with some [built-in components](https://theme-ui.com/components) that conveniently have some default styling. This is particularly useful if you want to bootstrap a project and have some basic styling right out of the box.

In this example, we are using Theme UI's `Button` component. Theme UI components have a default "variant", which in the case of `Button` is called "primary". In many cases, there are other built-in variants (such as "secondary" for the `Button` component). A `variant` is simply that: a variant of a particular component that has some styling differences. If you don't pass in a variant to your component, it will have the default stylings.

```jsx
export default {
    ... // rest of your theme
    buttons: { // Button component overrides
        primary: {
            color: 'background',
            bg: 'primary',
            '&:hover': {
                bg: 'text',
            }
        },
        secondary: {
            color: 'background',
            bg: 'secondary',
        },
    },
}
```

<Content>

## Custom Component variants

What if you want to customize or override any of the stylings that come with the Theme UI components?

Using the `Button` example from the previous slide, we can customize both the `primary` and `secondary` variant stylings to fit our particular theme. In the [Theme UI docs](https://theme-ui.com/components/variants) for "Component Variants", we find a list of all of the available components, their "variant group", and the name of their "default variant". For the `Button` component, the "variant group" is called `buttons`. So in our theme file, we can create a key called `buttons`. For its value, we create an object whose keys are the names of the variants we want to style. Then in our components, wherever we use the default `primary` variant for `Button`, it will use our color, background, and hover stylings from our theme over those same stylings that come from Theme UI by default. Likewise with wherever we use the `secondary` variant for `Button`.

<Zoom value={0.35}/>

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

export default (props) => (
  <div
    {...props}
    sx={{
      width: ["100%", "50%", "25%"],
    }}
  />
)
```

## Media Queries

Theme UI includes a shorthand syntax for mobile-first responsive styles so that you don't have to hard code media queries. In your theme, you can create a `breakpoints` array whose values are the screen widths at which you want your media query breakpoints. Then, in your component styling within the `sx` prop, you can set the value of a style to an array. Each index within that array corresponds with the same index of the `breakpoints` array in your theme. In this example, the width of this div will be 100% for the first breakpoint value, then 50% for the second, and 25% for the third.

If you need to skip a breakpoint, you can simply pass in a `null` value for that breakpoint value's index. This can be useful if you want to set a value for only the largest breakpoint.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

export default (props) => (
  <div
    {...props}
    sx={{
      width: [null, null, "25%"],
    }}
  />
)
```

<Zoom value={0.35}/>

```jsx
// example theme colors
{
    colors: {
        text: '#000',
        background: '#fff',
        primary: '#07c',
        modes: {
            dark: {
                text: '#fff',
                background: '#000',
                primary: '#0cf',
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Color modes

Dark mode is all the rage these days and with Theme UI, it's easier than ever. Within your theme, under `colors` you can create your default "light mode" colors. Then you can create a `modes` object. The names of the keys inside of `modes` will be the names of the different color modes that you want. In this example, we created a `dark` mode. When the color mode changes in our application, Theme UI is smart enough that it knows which values to look at. Anywhere where a color is set to the theme's `primary` color, it knows which one to look at based on what color mode you are in.

</Content>

<Zoom value={0.25}/>

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'
import { useColorMode } from 'theme-ui'

export default props => {
    const [colorMode, setColorMode] = useColorMode()

    return (
        <header>
            <button
                onClick={e => {
                    setColorMode(colorMode === 'default' ? 'dark' : 'default')
                }}>
                Toggle {colorMode === 'default' ? 'Dark' : 'Light'}
            </button>
        </header>
    )
}
```

<Content>

## Toggling Color modes

Now that we have our color mode colors set up in our theme, let's actually toggle them. Theme UI has a `useColorMode` hook built in that we can use instead of having to make our own custom hooks.

In this example, we can use the `useColorMode` hook to set the color mode in the button's `onClick` event. In this case, we're toggling back and forth between the `default` or light mode colors and `dark` mode colors. You can change the names of the modes to be the name of whatever color modes you created in your theme.

There is still more to learn and discuss about Theme UI. You can look at margin and padding, functional values, `Styled`, etc, but this should be enough to get you up and running with Theme UI!

And as always, take a peek at the [docs](https://theme-ui.com/getting-started) for more info :)
